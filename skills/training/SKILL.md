description: Launch and monitor prime-rl training runs. Use when starting, supervising, or debugging an RL/SFT run. Routes to `start-run` (entrypoints + how to launch) and `monitor-run` (logs, metrics, check-ins).

# Training

Two phases — start the run, then watch it.

- **Start a run** — see `start-run/SKILL.md` for the `rl`, `sft`, and `inference` entrypoints and how to launch them (single-node, SLURM, dry-run).
- **Monitor a run** — see `monitor-run/SKILL.md` for the runbook: how to find the output dir, what to tail, which metrics to watch, and how to restart safely.

Both subskills assume the `configs` skill for config-loading mechanics.

## Experiment record

For work under `experiments/`, follow the repository experiment-note policy:

- Before a launch, append the objective, hypothesis, config/overlay, and intended
  comparison to `experiments/notes/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- After inspection, append the job ID, measured evidence, decision, and next action.
- Record a failure or direction change in the daily note instead of accumulating
  historical rationale in the script or TOML header.
- Keep experiment comments and help text in English. Japanese research notes belong only
  under `experiments/notes/`.
- Update the relevant thematic note when a result changes the durable interpretation of
  the experiment.
