# Monitor a run

## Runbook

### On launch

1. Find the output dir and read the resolved configs at `{output_dir}/configs/` (start with `rl.toml`).
2. Confirm all processes are alive and the run is making progress.
3. Write the initial summary into `{output_dir}/STATUS.md`.
4. For runs under `experiments/`, add the job ID, output directory, and launch objective
   to `experiments/notes/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### Recurring check-ins

Default cadence: **1 hour** (researcher can override). At each check-in:

1. Confirm processes are alive.
2. Grep logs for errors/warnings; note current step and key metrics.
3. **Append** an entry to `{output_dir}/STATUS.md` (never overwrite):

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC

**Step**: {current_step} / {max_steps}
**Health**: {Healthy | Degraded | Down}

**Progress**: reward/mean, seq_len, truncation, eval scores, env-specific metrics.
**Stability**: entropy, mismatch_kl, grad_norm — flag spikes.
**Performance**: trainer vs orchestrator step time, env lag, inference pressure.

**Notes**: anything unusual (errors, restarts, hangs). Omit if nothing notable.
```

`STATUS.md` is the run-local operational log. When a check-in produces an experimental
finding, failure diagnosis, or direction change, also append the evidence, decision, and
next action to `experiments/notes/daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`. Do not copy routine healthy
check-ins into the repository note.

In W&B, each project auto-gets an **"overview" saved view** (train / eval / stability / performance sections) on its first run — use it for a quick check instead of the auto-generated default workspace.

### Restarting a run

**Never restart unless the researcher explicitly asked.** Confirm the exact restart command and the conditions that warrant one.

**Never** run kill or launch commands from your own shell. Dispatch them to the tmux **Launcher** window so the researcher sees what was executed:

```bash
SESSION=$(tmux display-message -p '#S')
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:Launcher" 'your command here' Enter
```

After a restart, verify all processes are back up and progress resumed before the next check-in.

## Reference

### Where to find things

- `scripts/tmux.sh` launches the run with a `Launcher` window in the named tmux session. The Claude window receives the output dir and session name in its appended prompt — if either is missing, **ask** rather than guess.
- `{output_dir}/configs/` — resolved TOMLs (`rl.toml` has the full picture).
- `{output_dir}/logs/` — see below.
- `{output_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/` — saved rollout traces (see Traces below).

### Logs

```
{output_dir}/logs/
├── trainer.log                # rank 0 stdout
├── orchestrator.log           # orchestrator stdout
├── inference.log              # vLLM stdout
├── trainer/

```

Usually tailing `trainer.log`, `orchestrator.log`, and `inference.log` is enough. Drop into per-node or per-rank logs only when debugging. All logs are loguru with `HH:mm:ss  LEVEL  message`; levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `SUCCESS`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`.

Scan for problems:

```bash
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {output_dir}/logs/{trainer,orchestrator,inference}.log
grep -E "WARNING|ERROR" {output_dir}/logs/envs/{train,eval}/*.log
```

### Metrics

All metrics print to the console log (and W&B when configured).

**Progress** — orchestrator log:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `reward/{all,env}/mean` | mean training reward |
| `seq_len/{all,env}/mean` | avg sequence length (tokens) |
| `num_turns/{all,env}/mean` | avg turns per rollout (multi-turn only) |
| `is_truncated/{all,env}/mean` | fraction truncated |
| `empty_rollouts/{all,env}`, `errored_rollouts/{all,env}` | fraction empty/errored |
| `metrics/{env}/{metric}` | env-specific (e.g. pass rate) |
| `eval/{env}/{avg@k,pass@k}` | eval scores when configured |

**Stability** — trainer log:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `mismatch_kl/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | KL between trainer and (old) inference policy over trainable tokens |
| `entropy/{all,env}/{mean,std,max}` | policy entropy over trainable tokens |
| `masked_advantage_{positive,negative}/mean` | fraction of DPPO-masked tokens with +/- advantage |
| `optim/grad_norm` | spikes may precede divergence |

**Performance** — trainer and orchestrator step independently, so comparing step times shows who's waiting on whom.

| Source | Metric | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| trainer | `time/step` | total trainer step |
| trainer | `time/wait_for_batch` | **high → orchestrator is bottleneck** |
| trainer | `time/forward_backward`, `time/broadcast_weights`, `time/save_ckpt` | phase timings |
| trainer | `perf/throughput`, `perf/mfu` | tokens/s and MFU % |
| orchestrator | `time/step`, `time/generate_completions`, `time/update_weights` | phase timings |
| orchestrator | `time/wait_for_ckpt` | **high → trainer is bottleneck** |
| orchestrator | `scheduler/async_level`, `scheduler/inflight_rollouts` | scheduler state |
| env server | event loop lag (min/mean/p90/p99/max), active task distribution | periodic |

For live vLLM stats, query Prometheus directly:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep -E "num_requests|gpu_cache_usage"
# vllm:num_requests_running, vllm:num_requests_waiting, vllm:gpu_cache_usage_perc (→1.0 = KV cache saturated)
```

### Traces

```
{output_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/all/traces.jsonl        # appended per rollout as it completes
{output_dir}/rollouts/step_N/{train,eval}/effective/traces.jsonl  # written per finalized batch / eval epoch
```

JSONL files of `vf.Trace` records (training tensors excluded). `all` gets every completed
rollout the moment it arrives — errored, filtered, and never-batched ones included — so it's
crash-durable; `effective` gets the clean subset that went into the step's train batch (eval:
the non-errored epoch cohort; multiple eval envs share the step file). Each record carries
`kind`, `env_name`, `group_id`, `policy_version`, and `eval_step`, plus `runtime` (config +
provisioned resource id, e.g. the sandbox id). Sampled nodes additionally carry `request_id`
(the engine request id — embeds the trace id, joins to `logs/requests/*.jsonl`) and
`request_ts` (turn-start wall-clock; `timestamp` is commit time, so the gap from a sampled
node's `timestamp` to the next sampled node's `request_ts` is that turn's tool-execution
window, and joining `request_ts` against `logs/weight_updates.jsonl` recovers the per-turn
policy version).

```bash
wc -l {output_dir}/rollouts/step_42/train/{all,effective}/traces.jsonl
jq '.rewards' {output_dir}/rollouts/step_42/train/effective/traces.jsonl
jq 'select(.errors != []) | {id, env_name, runtime}' {output_dir}/rollouts/step_*/train/all/traces.jsonl
```

The binary batches consumed by the trainer still live at `{output_dir}/rollouts/step_N/train_rollouts.bin`, next to the trace subtrees.

### Common failure modes

A few warnings are normal. Escalate when errors are persistent, growing, or hit a large fraction of rollouts.

- **Env workers**: exceptions in env code, timeouts, sandbox errors, OOM kills (most common source — runs user code).
- **Orchestrator**: empty/errored rollout spikes, weight-broadcast failures, checkpoint errors.
- **Trainer**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, NaN loss or gradients.
- **Inference**: NCCL/CUDA errors, OOM, request timeouts.

### Process tree

All processes use `setproctitle` so they're visible in `ps`/`htop`/`pstree`:

```
PRIME-RL::Launcher
├── PRIME-RL::Inference          (vLLM server, GPU 0)
├── PRIME-RL::Orchestrator       (CPU-only)
│   └── Verifiers::EnvServer     (ZMQ env server per environment)
│       └── Verifiers::EnvWorker0..N
├── torchrun
│   └── PRIME-RL::Trainer        (GPU 1+)
└── tail trainer.log
```

For multi-node runs, trainer and inference processes are on separate nodes — use `srun` or `ssh` to inspect them.
